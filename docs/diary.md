### ðŸ“… 2025-05-09 â€“ Component Setup & Page Responsibilities

- We divided the main client pages according to the project requirements.

- Therese began by building the first atomic components: **BaseInput** and **BaseButton**.

- She is responsible for the shared layout and user-related pages:

  - **Landing page**, **Header**, **Navigation/Menu**
  - **Login** and **Register** views
  - **User dashboard ("My Pages")** in the admin panel

- Jonatan and Alexandra are continuing to build their respective feature areas:

  - **Books** Jonatan: book list, individual book pages, and admin views:

    - Built the public book list view displaying all available books
    - Implemented navigation from the list to each bookâ€™s detail page
    - Created a form for adding new books with all required MongoDB fields

  - **Reviews** Alexandra: review functionality and integration with books:
    - Built review creation and listing features linked to individual books
    - Developed a shared book detail view showing book info and its reviews
    - Created a reusable StarRating.vue component for 1â€“5 star selection
    - Integrated the rating component into both the form and review display
    - Connected review data dynamically via API for real-time updates

> We'll update the task division as designs are finalized and implementation progresses.

## **Plan** : upload db exports and try setup on monday may 12th, 2025

### ðŸ“… 2025-05-16 â€“ Project conclusion

Overall, the project went well, and we are satisfied with both the final result and the collaboration within our group.

- The development of the API progressed smoothly and was completed quickly without major issues.
- The frontend development also went well, though it came with some challenges. As a team, we supported each other throughout the process and ensured that responsibilities were shared fairly.
- Towards the end of the project, progress slowed slightly due to the lack of a predefined route structure for the website, which led to some uncertainty in implementation. In hindsight, planning our route layout earlier would have improved efficiency in the final stages.

Despite this, the experience was positive and productive, and we gained valuable insights into both backend and frontend development, as well as teamwork and project coordination.
