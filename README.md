# 📚 Book App

A secure and modern fullstack web application for managing books and reviews – with user authentication, role-based access (admin), and RESTful API structure.

This was a group project built during the **API Development** course at **Medieinstitutet**. The goal was to design and develop both the frontend and backend, focusing on clean architecture, security, and usability.
